# Transport-of-Daughter-Nuclide
This repositiory presents a numerical model developed to simulate the transport of a daughter radionuclide ptoduced from the decay of parents radionuclide in a river system. The model is based on a system of coupled PDE that describe radioactive decay process and ADE transport dynamics in flowing water. The model was implemented in MATLAB script.
